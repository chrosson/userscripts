A year after that, mobile browser share began to take off and IE9 was released. Welcome to the beginning of 2011 and the dawn of modern web development.

It was used for silly effects, not building a website. Part of the problem was the domination of IE6,7,8 for so long with such weak support for Javascript (modern browsers can be literally hundreds of times faster) and incompatibility with official specifications (and Firefox).

jQuery offers *cross browser* functionality to make fundamental tasks work the same way everywhere. Using it gives you compatibility almost for free. It also gives convenience functions to make things easy for the developer. No wonder it's so popular.
